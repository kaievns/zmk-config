# ZMK Sweep keyboard config

My config for a sweep keyboard in ZMK

If you're interested how this thing works please refer to the
[documentation](./docs/index.md)

__WARNING__ don't blindly copypaste the keymap, it has a bunch of overrides
for my custom keyboard layout setup. Watch out for the `HM_` prefixed keycodes!
