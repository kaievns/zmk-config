# How this whole thing works

This setup came out of a few years of tinkering with minimal keyboards, 
primarily the 34 keyboards; which seems to be my thing. Maybe you can reapply
some of the principles to other geometries, though.

Also, a word of caution. Don't hold this for a gospel, this is just something
that worked for me over the years, it doesn't necessarily mean it's universally
true, other people have some great ideas too.

# Overview

There are five layers in this whole thing. Yeah, I know it seems like a lot, but
it really isn't. One could probably squeeze everything into four, or even three
if they drop the function keys.

The reason there are five layers and lots of unused buttons is because I'm
splitting everything into buckets by function, which seem to be easier on the
brains. The other reason is that the right hand is stronger and more dexterous
than the left one -- well if you're right handed --, it's easier to handle some
tasks by having them on the right side. Well, for me that is anyway.

Before going into the actual layers, there are couple of considerations that one
needs to familiarise themselves with because they affect the content of those
layers:

* [Punctuation principles](./punctuation.md)
* [Layer switching mechanics](./layer-switching.md)
* [The home row mods setup](./home-row-mods.md)

So, the layers are:

1. [QWERTY](./qwerty.md) - the default layer that has most of a regular keyboard
2. [Navigation](./navigation.md) - has the navigation buttons and main punctuation
3. [Editing](./editing.md) - has the programming punctuation and editing shortcuts
4. [Numbers](./numbers.md) - has the numbers and math symbols
5. `System` - has the F... buttons and system utils
