# The numbers layer

The numbers layer is the simplest, but also the weirdest in this setup. Overall it looks like so:

```
╭───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────╮   ╭───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────╮
│       │       │       │       │       │   │  /    │  4    │  5    │  9    │  *    │
├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤   ├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤
│  GUI  │  ALT  │  SHFT │  CTL  │       │   │  .    │  1    │  2    │  3    │  +    │
├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤   ├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤
│       │       │  %    │   $   │       │   │  ,    │  8    │  6    │  7    │  -    │
╰───────┴───────┴───────┼───────┼───────┤   ├───────┼───────┼───────┴───────┴───────╯
                        │       │       │   │  =    │  0    │
                        ╰───────┴───────╯   ╰───────┴───────╯
```

If you look closely at the positioning of the numbers you notice a werid positioning of the symbols.
That is called natural or usage frequency based location of the numbers.

In a nut shell there is a spicific distribution of digits in nature. Digits `1`, `2`, and `3` apper 
much more often than say `8` and `6`. Moreover, digits `123` often go together, and so do `4` and `5`. 
And hence the layer places the digits in a very specific order.

This is a bit of a double edged blade. It is definitely very confusing at the beginnig and something
to get used to. But, if you type a fair bit of natural numbers, you quickly start to appreciate the
additional comfort and the snappy rollingness of this setup.

I personally do a lot of CAD drawing, because I like engineering physical stuff. I type in parts
dimentions all the time, and I believe for me personally this arrangement has a lot of benefit and
well worth getting used to. Well, that and the fact that I'm a keyboard optimistation junkie and
very much used to getting used to weird setups.

If you're primarily a software engineer and such, and generally nubres avoidant. I would recommend
a normall numpad here.

And another small touch, I guess, worth mentioning here is that the `enter` button swaps to `=` here.
This is very handy and natural when you're using calculators. A lot of software would trigger on either
one, but it's handy when they dont. Or you need to bang out a formula or something like that. Saperes
me a jump to another layer.
