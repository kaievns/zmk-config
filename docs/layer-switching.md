# Thumb buttons and layer switching

The reason I have 5 layers is because my keyboards have 4 thumb buttons: two on
the left and two on the right. I tried setups with 6 and 2 thumb buttons, and I
like 4 the most. I'm not sure whats the reason, but that's how my brain works, 4
seems like the optimal number. Hence I have 5 layers, a default + 4 layers
activated by the thumb buttons as a mod-tap setup.

## The thumb row configuration

The default thumb row looks like so:

```
╭──────────┬──────────╮   ╭──────────┬──────────╮
&lt 4 TAB  &lt 3 SPACE   &lt 2 ENTER &lt 5 BSPC
╰──────────┴──────────╯   ╰──────────┴──────────╯
```

The `&lt number` means the mod-tap layer switch, meaning the button is used as a
layer switch on press and hold, and it serves as a regular button when a regular
key tap occurs.

If you know your keyboards, you notice that it looks sort of like cradio/sweep
setup, but with space and enter buttons swapped places. there are two primary
reasons for that.

1. it is a more natural action to use right hand for the `enter` actions
2. i use a custom keyboard layout that is more natural to type with space on the
   left hand side

Mileage can differ obviously, and it's a pain to retrain yourself to use the
left hand for typing spaces. Worth the effort in my opinion. If anything swap
them back

Also, keep in mind that I change some buttons symbols in the thumb row depending
on the layout. for example `space` becomes `_` in the symbols layer, and `enter`
becomes `=` in the numbers layer.

## Layer switching

There is a bit of rationale behind how layer switching is assigned to the thumb
buttons.

1. The navigation layer has the arrow buttons on the right side and it's
   activated by holding the right primary thumb button (enter). The reason for
   this is to be able to use navigation buttons with just one hand. The other
   hand is used ~~to hold a sandwich~~ to press home row mods, for selection,
   jumps, etc.
2. In a similar fashion the editing layer is switched by holding the left
   primary thumb button down. The reason is because it activates the
   undo/cut/copy/paste/redo buttons on the left, which makes for very neat one
   handed basic editing operations. I also have fake ALTAB and ALTILD buttons on
   the left side as well, which together with the left thumb activation creates
   a fake but very familiar ALT-TAB action for switching between windows.
3. The numbers layer is activated by holding the secondary thumb button. Which
   frees the right hand to operate the number pad on the right side of the
   keyboard
4. The system layer as the least used one, uses the last remaining secondary
   thumb button on the right.

## A word on geometry

This setup is actually specific to the cradio/sweep keyboard, and it looks
differently on others. Here is a setup I used on a corne keyboard.

```
╭──────────┬──────────╮   ╭──────────┬──────────╮
&lt 3 SPACE &lt 4 TAB     &lt 5 ENTER &lt 2 BSPC
╰──────────┴──────────╯   ╰──────────┴──────────╯
```

The reason for difference is because cradio/sweep keyboards are heavily
vertically staggered to better align finger movements with an ortholinear
keyboard columns.

The net result of the heavy stagger is that the keyboard halves are rotated a
bit, and therefore your primary thumbs shift inward. If on corne the primary
(naturally positioned) thumb buttons are the middle ones, on a sweep keyboard
those will be the outside buttons.

Because of that I have the buttons rearranged the way they are.

Overall, i believe the sweep keyboard has a superior thumbs placement due to
keyboard halves rotation, albeit it might look the same on a picture.
