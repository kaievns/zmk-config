# Punctuation setup

Most of the punctuation is split between two layers, the reason for this is that there are two halves of the keyboard and to reach to the punctuation level I'm using the left or right hand respectively. It is actually simpler to think about it this way, the rest of the keyboard was built around the punctuation setup, rather than punctuation setup was squeezed into existing layers. Here is how the punctuation looks like in the nut shell

```
╭───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────╮   ╭───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────╮
│  ^    │  {    │  *    │  }    │       │   │       │       │       │       │       │
├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤   ├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤
│  !    │  (    │  #    │  )    │       │   │       │       │       │       │       │
├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤   ├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤
│  ?    │  @    │  %    │  $    │       │   │       │       │       │       │       │
╰───────┴───────┴───────┼───────┼───────┤   ├───────┼───────┼───────┴───────┴───────╯
                        │       │  _    │   │       │       │
                        ╰───────┴───────╯   ╰───────┴───────╯

╭───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────╮   ╭───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────╮
│       │       │       │       │       │   │       │  [    │  -    │  ]    │  `    │
├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤   ├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤
│       │       │       │       │       │   │  ~    │  <    │  =    │  >    │ '     │
├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤   ├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤
│       │       │       │       │       │   │  &    │  /    │  |    │  \    │ "     │
╰───────┴───────┴───────┼───────┼───────┤   ├───────┼───────┼───────┴───────┴───────╯
                        │       │       │   │       │       │
                        ╰───────┴───────╯   ╰───────┴───────╯
```

Those two layers represent the [navigation](./navigation.md) and [editing](./editing.md) layers. I left the other halves empty so you could focus on the punctuation itself. Now lets get to the principles how those symbols are organised.

## Hands mechanics

First of all, there is purely hands mechanics. Your strongest typing positions are the home row, the lower row pinkies and the top row for the ring, middle and the pinter fingers.

As you noticed that is where the most common symbols go to. Also, you can notice that the least common symbols, such as `^` , `%` and `|` are occupying the most awkward positions.

Secondly, the pairing symobls: such as `()` , `{}` , etc, are split between the ring and pointer fingers which together work as one of the best known "rolling" typing mechanics.

## Programming and Typing mechanics

The other aspect that is taken in consideration here is how typing mechanics works in a modern programming environment.

Firstly, most setups have brackets pairing autocompletion those days. And so you're much more likely to correct a wrong closing bracket than actually type it explicitly. Having that row between the open and close brackets helps hands to be less confused about their location, rather than when they're next to each other.

Secondly, modern programming languages almost universally have all sorts of arrows in them everywhere `->` , `=>` , `|>` , etc. So, this punctuation setup allows for a quick rolling right side motion to type those arrows. Not to mention the HTML tags that we all almost universally have to type on a daily basis.

Thirdly, some special characters are more special than the others. `/` - in all UNIX paths and comments, so it's neat to have it nice and handy. `$` and `@` are variable name markers in many programming languages, and `?` mark is all over the place.

Finally, if you're like me and write a fair bit of documentation, particularly markdown, you really want to have those `#` and `*` symbols nearby.

## Logical organisation

There is yet another dimension to this setup, which groups symbols logically. This helps with remembering where everything is, but also helps with producing less confusion in the brains when it comes to actually using the thing.

* I have already mentioned the paired brackets, that's easy to grasp.
* The quotation marks, backtick,  `'`, and `"` are in one row
* All the slashes `/|\` are in one group
* The `?` and `!` in one mini-group as well
* The space button turns into the `_` symbol
